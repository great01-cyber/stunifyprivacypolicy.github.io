# Privacy Policy for **[Stunify]**

**Last updated:** 31 December 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how **[Stunify]** (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, stores, and protects your information when you use our mobile application (the “App”).

By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

---

## 1. Who We Are

- **App Name:** [Stunify]  
- **Purpose:** A student-focused donation platform  
- **Developer/Operator:** [Ujah Obinna John]  
- **Support Email:** [greatujah088@gmail.com]  
- **Country:** United Kingdom

---

## 2. Student Verification & Access Levels

The App is designed primarily for students. Verified student accounts (for example, emails ending with **“ac.uk”**) can donate items and can also request/receive items. Any account that does not have an email ending with **“ac.uk”** will be treated as a non-student account. Non-student accounts may donate items but cannot request or receive items. We may update verification rules and access levels over time to protect the student community.

### How verification works in practice

- We determine account type based on the **email domain** used during registration.
- We do **not** read your emails or access your inbox.
- Your access level is applied automatically:

| Account Type | Can Donate | Can Request / Receive |
|------------|------------|-----------------------|
| Student (`ac.uk`) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Non-Student | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
